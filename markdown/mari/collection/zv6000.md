# HP Pavilion zv6000
---
The HP Pavilion zv6000 is a Socket 939 laptop made by HP, likely made in Q2 of 2005. It uses Desktop Athlon 64 CPUs, and has Xpress 200M Integrated Graphics, with optional 128MB GDDR-500 of Dedicated Sideport Memory.

## History
This zv6000 was given to me by my Step Aunt without a power brick. I later got a power brick and it turned on with no fuss. The Original Battery worked just fine, and also the thermal paste it had was still plenty wet. It came with a 3200+ Venice, a 100GB HDD, and 1GB of RAM. I ended up writing an extremely long, weirdly worded, and partially wrong thing about it

The HP Pavilion Zv6000 series is a fairly obfuscated Laptop, with little information available online. They were mostly mid-rangeish Laptops. I didn't think much of mine, thinking it was some 2004 clawhammer nonsence, however, when I ran CPU-Z, I was at first confused, as the CPU was Socket 939. Socket 939 isnt for laptops, I thought. Later, some factchecking proved me correct. It was a desktop Socket, and I later opened up my specimen, a Zv6203cl, which was likely used by a Teacher or Professor in its past life, and I had a hard time getting it open, I ended up destroying some screw posts, and borking the display connector, nearly ruining the Laptop. I eventually got to the CPU, which was Indeed a Desktop Athlon 64. I repasted it, though it really didn't need it. I thought it being a desktop CPU was quite odd, given its mostly boring existence. During my disasembly however, I damanged the Display connector by plugging it in upside down, bending one of the display connector's pins, on both sides of the connector. Using tweezers, I broke off part of the Motherboard side in order to fix the port. I also did the same for the Display side. I was shocked and relived that this did fix the display issue. I later investigated the CPU situation. Early Athlon 64 X2s are available for the Socket 939, and the Chipset in this PC, the ATi RS480M, is compatible with them, apparently. The PSU is 120 Watts, however the Athlon 64 it comes with only uses 67 Watts. I suspect that the rest of the System would use up to 30 Watts max, likely closer to 20 Watts, Leaving somewhere in the ballpark of 25 Watts not used. Additionally, the highest Temp this Laptop ever got, being in a warm room on a bed burried in blankets, was only 58C, which is very low for laptop standards. I suspect that this was originally going to be HP's answer to the Inspirion 9100, but corporate wanted to push another Home PC, locking this potential behind a boring home PC, along with a decent iGPU.

Okay, let's unpack some of this. It's zv6000, not Zv6000. It's not super poorly documented actually. They were moreso targeted to the low end. No Athlon 64 X2 CPU can work in this system, some won't POST and the others will only give you 1 of the 2 cores. The extra headroom was actually intended for older Athlon 64 CPUs such as NewCastle-based Athlon 64s, which HP sometimes used because they were cheaper than Venice. It also likely wasn't intended for being high end at all, but rather it just happened to perform extremely well for a budget laptop.

Later, I ended up killing my original motherboard by flashing a poorly made BIOS Mod I created that bodged in the Microcode board from a Desktop board with a similar chipset and X2 CPU Support to the zv6000. I later bought a parts machine and stole it's motherboard to fix this zv6000.
